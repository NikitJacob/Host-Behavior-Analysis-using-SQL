2. Analysis on how does the comments of reviewers vary for listings of Super Hosts vs Other Hosts(By extracting words from the comments provided by the reviewers)

3. Analysis on the average price and availability of the listings for the upcoming year between Super Hosts and Other Hosts

4. Comparative Analysis on Large Property listing based on Super Host and Other Hosts

5. Analyzing the difference in above mentioned trends between Local Hosts or Hosts residing in other locations 

6. Figuring out meaningful insights by creating different charts using EXCEL
